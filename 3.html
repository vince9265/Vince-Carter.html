    <h2>3. Relationship with T-Mac</h2>
    <p><p>For all of Raptor Vince Carter's many virtues, he's not a patient
man. Tooling around Toronto in his black Navigator, Carter taps
anxiously on the dashboard at each red light. In the electronic
warehouse that doubles as his sprawling condo overlooking Lake
Ontario, he keeps four remotes on his coffee table so he can
instantaneously change channels or switch CDs. A fledgling golfer
who shoots in the high 90s, Carter usually starts his backswing
before he has finished strolling to the ball. "Even as a child,
he would get impatient real easy," says Vince's mother, Michelle
Carter-Robinson. "Sometimes I'd have to tell him to relax, calm
down and go to a movie or something."
</p>
<p>Young, restless and preposterously talented, Carter was a bundle
of nerves during the (to hear him tell it) excruciatingly long
off-season. Ever since the end of the 1998-99 campaign, when he
made a telegenic ascent to stardom, earning the Rookie of the
Year Award and nearly leading the Raptors to the playoffs for the
first time in the franchise's four-year history, Carter, a 6'6"
forward, has been pining to start his second season and get back
to the business of basketball. When you're 22, on the cusp of
greatness and playing for a team on the upswing, delayed
gratification is a burden that's hard to bear. "Last season was
great, but it feels like ancient history," Carter says, looking
out the window of his condo. "I'm ready to keep showing what I
can do. When I say ready, I mean I'm ready now."</p>
